    "lama1": "January 2015 - January 2018",
    "dekripsi kerja1": "- As an airline catering service staff, the first thing I did was check the flight schedule to find out how many aircraft and which routes were operating.\n- Check the completeness of goods and food ready to be loaded into the aircraft cabin according to the flight route.\n- The items in question include tissues, napkins, plastic tea spoons, paper cups, plastic cups, roll tissue, and bottled water, while the food consists of snacks and frozen meals that will be placed into the galley trolley. The quantity of these goods and foods depends on how many landings the aircraft will operate.\n- After all goods and foods were checked and complete according to the flight route, my team and I prepared to go to the field to uplift or load all items in the galley trolley into the aircraft using an HTC truck. The food and drinks inside the trolley would later be used by flight attendants to serve passengers during the flight.\n- Once everything had been loaded into the aircraft, my team and I monitored and checked other aircraft to ensure the remaining stock of goods on board was sufficient for the next flight. If something was lacking, it would be reloaded; if sufficient, no replacement was needed.",
